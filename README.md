# quantum-nfts
Script generation.ipynb is used to generate contour maps from Wigner function cross sections. Requires Python 3.9 and Qutip 4.6 as well as standard packages Matplotlib and Numbpy. 

The .png files represent the quasi-probability distributions of different quantum states in phase-space, ranging from single, double, triple or dozen-Fock states, as well as the squeezed state, cat state and several random kets in Hilbert spaces of different dimensions. These have been minted as NFT's on Opensea (https://opensea.io/collection/qu-gen). My hope would be to eventually run the generative code on chain, but the source code is too bulky for this to be feasible at the moment. In general, I would love to see more scientific data or images be minted as NFT's and monetized, this could be a great way to generate more funding for scientific research, whilst donors (i.e. NFT buyers) would perhaps feel more connected to a particular project.
